Their Marketing team is responsible for increasing brand awareness, market share, and product development. They conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents. Peter Pandey, a marketing data analyst is tasked to convert these survey results to meaningful insights which the team can use to drive actions.

## Task

## Some Important insights from the dashboard:
•	Energy drinks are more popular among the male population, followed by females and the non-binary population.

•	 The age group "19-45" has the highest number of consumers, and it is crucial to target this consumer segment more effectively.

•	Online advertising stands as the most popular and effective channel to engage with young customers.

•	Caffeine is the most preferred ingredient among all genders, followed by vitamins, sugar, and Guarana.

•	Compact and portable cans are the most popular packaging preferences among consumers due to their convenience in terms of portability and aesthetic appeal. They are not only easy to carry but also provide a stylish and visually appealing look when held in one's hands.

•	Cola-Coka, Bepsi, and Gangsters are the current market leaders in the energy drinks business.

•	Brand Reputation is the biggest reason for choosing the brand in all the cases.

•	Bangalore is leading the charts in terms of the number of respondents, followed by Hyderabad and Mumbai. CodeX should focus more on Hyderabad and Mumbai since they have tremendous potential for growth. Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate the reasons behind Lucknow having the lowest number of respondents and work towards improving those numbers.

•	In terms of purchase location preference, energy drink consumers clearly prefer buying their energy drinks from supermarkets and online stores the more.

•	In terms of consumption situation preference, energy drink consumers clearly prefer consuming their energy drinks during sports/exercise and while studying/working late.
